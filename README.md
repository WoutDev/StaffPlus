# StaffPlus
A very useful Bukkit plugin that contains various moderation tools.

This plugin was first written around July of 2015 and I cleaned up the code a lot just to upload this since I was inexperienced at the time I wrote it. I did not fully go through all of the code, so some of the code still may be a bit wonky here and there.

For some reason, the code formatting was lost during upload so a lot of the code is not tabbed or spaced right.
